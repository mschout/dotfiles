# Commit Skill

Group uncommitted changes into logical feature commits.

## Steps

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` (staged + unstaged) to understand all changes
2. Analyze all changed files and group them by logical feature/intent (e.g. "DB migration", "auth refactor", "UI fixes")
3. For each logical group, stage only the files belonging to that group and commit using ANSI-C quoting (`$'...\n...'`) with a concise, action-oriented message (e.g. "Add X", "Fix Y", "Refactor Z"). No conventional commit prefixes. Example:
   ```bash
   git commit -m $'Add ranking game web layer\n\nControllers, ViewComponents, SSE, CSS animations'
   ```
4. Repeat step 3 until all changes are committed
5. Run `git log --oneline -n <number-of-new-commits>` to show the resulting commits
6. Report the resulting commits

## What to avoid

- **never** add a Co-Authored-By, Assisted-By etc entry in the commit message
- **never** add a `refs #12345` entry in the commit message, a git pre-commit
  will automatically populate that if necessary
